    <Description>
		<Header>Description</Header>
		Allow high-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating frequencies below the cutoff frequency.
		
		This unit implements a first-order IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) high-pass filter by subtracting a low-pass filtered version of the signal from the original. The filter uses an exponential smoothing parameter alpha derived from the cutoff frequency and sample rate. The output maintains the same shape and data type as the input.
		
		Supports float32 data type only.

		<Header>Usage</Header>
		Use the High Pass Filter to remove low-frequency components like DC offset or drift, isolate high-frequency features, or eliminate rumble and baseline wander from sensor signals.

	  <DoubleOption name="cutoff_freq" text="Cutoff Frequency" description="Cutoff frequency (Hz) where the filter begins to attenuate signals. Frequencies below this are suppressed, frequencies above pass through. Typical values: 0.1-100 Hz depending on application." default="10" />
